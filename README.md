This site is old and deprecated. I have started a redesign of the site at www.streamn.live

This is a project to make a PlugDJ Clone for personal use. PlugDJ is a website that synchronizes video playing among members in lobbies.
Each lobby member may join the queue to play their video. Each member may have playlists associated to their accounts that they can play in any lobby.
Recently, PlugDj changed their UI for the worse and I wanted an alternative application to use with friends. I don't intend on using this clone for commercial use,
which is a reason why I'm putting this repository on Github. 

If you would like to run the App

0.) Make sure you have Node.js installed

1.) Clone the repo to desired location

2.) Open the command console and navigate to the repo.

3.) Run 'npm install'. This will download all of the node packages needed to run the app

4.) Run 'npm run start'. This will start the front end of the application.

5.) Your default browser should open to the application, but if it doesn't, open for browser and navigate to 'localhost:3000' which is the default location for the app.

As of 11/30/2018, I have deployed this app to a production environment which is viewable at www.clubin.club
